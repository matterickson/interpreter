# interpreter
A year back I was working on an interpreter for a school project. It was responsible for parsing a String input 
to determine if it was a valid program and if it was, determine the output. The algorithm uses a recursive descent 
parser to determine if the program follows the correct syntax. It then builds an intermediate representation of 
the program in a binary tree and finally interprets the tree to determine the output.

The language supports integers and doubles, functions, recursion and a print statement.

The file GUI is a runnable java file that contains a JPanel for the user to program in.
The file MyApplet is a JApplet that can run the program in browser (assuming your browser still runs Java applets).

You are welcome to use this code for any of your own projects.  If you have any questions about this project you can email me at matterickson@hotmail.com
