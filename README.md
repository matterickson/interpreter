# interpreter
A year back I was working on an interpreter for a school project. It was responsible for parsing a String input 
to determine if it was a valid program and if it was, determine the output. The algorithm uses a recursive descent 
parser to determine if the program follows the correct syntax. It then builds an intermediate representation of 
the program in a binary tree and finally interprets the tree to determine the output.

The language supports integers and doubles, functions, recursion and a print statement.
